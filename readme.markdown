dotfiles
========

Configuration files for open-source applications

...or, as [Tim Pope][tpope] put it, "[Here be dragons.][dragon]"

To install, clone the repository and create symbolic links to allow the apps to find the `rc` files:

	ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile

and so forth.
